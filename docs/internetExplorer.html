        Internet Explorer (formerly Microsoft Internet Explorer and Windows Internet Explorer, 
        commonly referred to as Explorer and abbreviated IE or MSIE) is a series of graphical web browsers developed by Microsoft 
        and included in the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, starting in 1995. It was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 that year. 
        Later versions were available as free downloads, or in service packs, 
        and included in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) service releases of Windows 95 and later versions of Windows. 
        The browser is discontinued, but still maintained.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Internet Explorer was one of the most widely used web browsers, attaining a peak of about 95% usage share by 2003.
        This came after Microsoft used bundling to win the first browser war against Netscape, which was the dominant browser in the 1990s. 
        Its usage share has since declined with the launch of Firefox (2004) and Google Chrome (2008), and with the growing popularity of operating systems 
        such as Android and iOS that do not run Internet Explorer. 
        Estimates for Internet Explorer's market share are about 2.88% across all platforms or by StatCounter's numbers ranked 6th, while on desktop, 
        the only platform it's ever had significant share (i.e. excluding mobile and Xbox) it's ranked 3rd at 6.01%, just after Firefox 
        (others place IE 2nd with 9.48% just ahead of), as of October 2018 (browser market share is notoriously difficult to calculate). 
        Microsoft spent over US$100 million per year on Internet Explorer in the late 1990s, with over 1,000 people involved in the project by 1999.
      </p>
       <p class="lead">
       Versions of Internet Explorer for other operating systems have also been produced, including an Xbox 360 version called Internet Explorer 
       for Xbox and for platforms Microsoft no longer supports: Internet Explorer for Mac and Internet Explorer for UNIX (Solaris and HP-UX),
       and an embedded OEM version called Pocket Internet Explorer, later rebranded Internet Explorer Mobile made for Windows Phone, Windows CE, and previously,
       based on Internet Explorer 7 for Windows Mobile.
       On March 17, 2015, Microsoft announced that Microsoft Edge would replace Internet Explorer as the default browser on its Windows 10 devices. 
       This effectively makes Internet Explorer 11 the last release (however IE 10 and 9 also receive security updates as of 2018). 
       Internet Explorer, however, remains on Windows 10 primarily for enterprise purposes. Since January 12, 2016, only Internet Explorer 11 has been supported.
      Support varies based on the operating system's technical capabilities and its support lifecycle.
       <p class="lead">
        The browser has been scrutinized throughout its development for use of third-party technology 
        (such as the source code of Spyglass Mosaic, used without royalty in early versions) and security and privacy vulnerabilities,
        and the United States and the European Union have alleged that integration of Internet Explorer with Windows has been to the detriment of fair browser competition.
